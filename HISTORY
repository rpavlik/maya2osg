WHATEVER	WHENEVER	Javier Taibo <javier.taibo@gmail.com>
	BUG FIX. Camera and animation files are now exported to the same directory of the exported file, not to current directory
	BUG FIX. Camera configuration did not fit render settings. Aspect ratio was not correctly computed. Now it matches exactly the render Maya render view
	Configuration option -enableBumpMapping to enable or disable bump mapping when exporting GLSL shaders
	Texture anisotropic filtering. Export configuration option -maxAnisotropy to set the maximum number of samples to use
	New export configuration options: exporting normals and exporting texture coordinates can now be disabled from the GUI
	BUG FIX. Opaque geometry was put into transparent bin
	Bump mapping. Automatic conversion from bump to normal maps
	Meshes export tangent arrays to be used in shading effects like bump mapping
	Support for Maya shading nodes: Lambert, SurfaceShader, FileTexture, Bump2D
	Added framework to export Maya shading networks to GLSL code (see documentation in the wiki page)
	Implemented backface culling and double side illumination in the GLSL shader
	Multiple texture coordinate sets (Maya UV sets) for use in GLSL shaders. Each texture connected to a shader channel use the corresponding TC set
	Shading code revamp. Now OpenGL fixed function pipeline is limited to only one color texture (optionally including transparency)
	Added two handy buttons to the shelf: toggle face normals display and reverse polygon normals. Very handy to quickly check and correct single side polygonal surfaces

	Previsualization from Maya uses camera configuration from active panel (if exported)
	BUG FIX exporting cameras under transform nodes. Now the whole hierarchy is correctly applied
	BUG FIX exporting camera animations. Path was wrong when converting from Y-up to Z-up
	BUG FIX in importer. It crashed when importing geometry with normals but no normal indices
	Per-fragment lighting Lambert shader (with fallback to OpenGL material if shader not supported)
	Config option for creating GLSL shaders. Preliminary support for GLSL shaders (lambert w/o textures)

	Added a button to "export and preview" in the option box
	Option to convert from Y-Up to Z-Up coordinate system when exporting
	Particle systems preliminary support
	Maya GUI dialog window for exporter configuration
	New maya2osg command-line options (-exportDefaultCameras, -exportOrthoCameras, -surfaceMode, -texClampMode, ...)
	Test models/scenes in a Maya project
	Single/double sided surfaces (backface culling) and two-side lighting mode
	Import geometry normals
	Automated installation for current user after compilation in Visual Studio
	Installation batch file for Windows (INSTALL.bat)
