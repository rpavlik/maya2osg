Compilation instructions
========================

Linux
-----

Select the Maya version you intend to compile the plug-in for and change to
this directory. Change to Linux directory and execute the GNU Makefile. The
maya2osg.so file will be created in the bin directory inside the maya version
directory. If you want to install the plug-in in default directory, execute
"make install" with the adequate permissions (executing it as root will do).

Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio)
---------------------------------

Select the Maya version you intend to compile the plug-in for and change to 
this directory. Use the solution in the Visual Studio folder for your version.
If the exact version is not available, you can convert a previous one (it 
should be fairly easy). If you have created and tested a new version 
and want to contribute them to the project, it will be welcome.
Add to "Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > VC++ Directories" the 
bin, include and lib directories of the installed Maya SDK and OSG libraries.


Installation
============

Under Linux, just do a "make install" as root (or the adequate user to write
under MAYA_DIR/bin/plug-ins).

Current Visual Studio project try to install the plug-in (maya2osg.mll)
in the plug-ins directory of Maya 2010 in its default location. However, it
can fail because of file permissions, so check it.
This issue will be fixed in the future.

For more detailed information on the installation of the plug-in in Maya,
