This folder contains some scenes/models to test and validate MayaOSG exporter and importer.


TEST1. Geometry
---------------

Features tested:

* Polygon meshes
* Per face vertex normals (hard edges and soft edges) -> OpenGL per vertex normals
* Single and double sided surfaces. Surface orientation -> OpenGL backface culling

Exporter supports all these features. 
Importer does not consider backface culling, all the geometry is created with default behaviour (double sided).
